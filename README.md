# README: Message Encoding and Decoding

## Overview
This project provides a simple yet effective tool for **message encoding and decoding** using a secure key-based mechanism. Users can enter a message, encode it with a generated key, and later decode it using the same key to retrieve the original message.

## Features
- **Secure Encoding:** Converts plain text messages into an encoded format using a key.
- **Key-Based Decoding:** Users must provide the correct key to decode the message.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using `Tkinter` for an interactive GUI.
- **Randomized Security:** Uses `random` module to enhance encoding.
- **Timestamp Logging:** Utilizes `datetime` and `time` libraries for tracking operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core Logic)
- **Tkinter** (Graphical User Interface)
- **Datetime** (Timestamp logging)
- **Random** (Key generation)
- **Time** (Execution delay simulation)

## How It Works
1. **Encoding:**
   - Enter a message in the input field.
   - Click the "Encode" button to generate an encoded message along with a key.
   - Save the key securely for later decoding.

2. **Decoding:**
   - Enter the encoded message.
   - Provide the correct key.
   - Click the "Decode" button to retrieve the original message.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.6).
2. Install required dependencies (Tkinter is included by default in most Python installations).
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement encryption algorithms for stronger security.
- Add a feature to store encoded messages securely.
- Integrate file-based input and output support.
